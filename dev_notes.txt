will deliver RESTful microservice that allows to chat with GPT API endpoint while preserving conversation context, 

this current implementation remembers conversation history for different users
users have regular and premium tier to limit API usage

flask itself is responsible for threading

------------------------------
put your OpenAI API key into config.py file

how to install:
pip install flask
pip install openai


start flask daemon as: 
python3 app.py


flask daemon runs on port 5001 with current configuration
communicate with flask with RESTful call (for example with curl):

each user is identified by user_id and conversation history is stored in separate text file for each user, 
so GPT remembers context of each conversation.
